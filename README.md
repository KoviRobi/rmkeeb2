My second experiment at making a keyboard. Not that the first one is bad, more
because it's a hobby and I'm always learning new stuff. If it's helpful to you
feel free to say so, or just want to discuss something also feel free to pop by
in the discussion or issues bit.

Also just wanted to say I'm feeling great right now, and I should take the time
to appreciate feeling great. Who knows what I'll think of this when I'm feeling
down, maybe hope, or maybe feeling like Mabel at the end of "The
Inconveniencing". Still, not dwelling on that right now, as I tend to have an
unhelpful habit there.
